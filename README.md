## NFL Combine Ultimate.ipynb Spring 2019
#### Project description	
NFL Combine Individual Forecasting; our project is a data analysis. Our main goal was to ease the analysis of past NFL Combine participants’ event test results and measurables by position to give the user insight on how they compare with their own results and measurables. We believe that our project would be essential to the thousands of high school and college football players who dream of going to the National Football League by giving them a visual and information that can not only show what the people who tend to get drafted are capable of but also where they fall in comparison.

## INST314Project.Rmd Fall 2019
#### Project description	
Through RStudio, I evaluated a research question asking if an individual’s health insurance (response variable) was dependent on their citizenship status (explanatory variable). Garnering the response and explanatory variables from the 2017 American Community Data for MD, I explored the counts through a contingency table and visualized them. I conducted a chi square dependency test that outputted a small p-value allowing me to accept my alternative hypothesis of there being an association. However, a causal relationship could not be determined because the study was observational.
