This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
source("http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/arbuthnot.R")
arbuthnot
dim(arbuthnot)
names(arbuthnot)
arbuthnot
arbuthnot$boys
arbuthnot$girls
plot(x=arbuthnot$year, y=arbuthnot$girls, type = "l")
#There is trend of more girls being baptized as time passes
5218+4683
arbuthnot$boys + arbuthnot$girls
```


```{r}
plot(x=arbuthnot$year, y=arbuthnot$boys+arbuthnot$girls, type = "l")
5218/4683
5218/(5218+4683)
arbuthnot$boys/(arbuthnot$boys+arbuthnot$girls)
plot(x=arbuthnot$year, y=arbuthnot$boys/(arbuthnot$boys+arbuthnot$girls), type = "l")
#It is difficult to make concise observations of the plot it varies a lot.
arbuthnot$boys > arbuthnot$girls
```


```{r}
source("http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/present.R")
dim(present)
names(present)
present$year
 # In comparison with arbuthnot, present is similar with same column names and amount
plot(x=present$year, y= present$boys/(present$boy+present$girls), type="l")
#The proportion of boys decreases over time so arbuthnot's observation of boys born in greater proportion does not hold up in the U.S
plot(x=present$year, y= present$boy+present$girls, type="l")
present
#1961 is the year with the most births

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
